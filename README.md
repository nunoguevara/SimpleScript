# SimpleScript
## What is this?
Basically, this is a SimpleScript which is a simple interpreted language, like it names, it's so simple. It has a few syntax and very beginner friendly(especially if you're a student), it's written in Python, and with the source code of this, you can also understand the few elements on Python

## Syntax and mechanics
There are a few syntax in this very simplified language.
- "out" for print a message, it just like print() in Python but more simple, to use it, first type out, and second click space and then type the text that you want to print
- "in" it's for a user input, it has a very simple mechanics, first type "in" and then space and variables name, after it, now you can enter the value of the variable with in syntax
- variable, so, there's 2 method to declare a variable, the one is with in, and second with declaring variable name, space and then equal sign and after it, click space again and enter a variable value. Variables are mutable and the value can changed it by re-declare it. And variable name can't contain any spaces
- calling a variable, if you want to call the variable, just type the name of variable, and then the value of it will be printed
- "abt" basically, this is just a credit syntax
- "math" so this is the math syntax that added in 0.1a update, it adds a math operation, first, type "math" and then click enter, then you can do math operation with 3 arguments, first is the first number, and second is the sign, "+" for addition "-" for subtraction "*" for multiplication "/" for distribution sign. And the third argument is the second number. To see the results, you can click "Enter", remember, you can't use the math operation like 8 + 7 + 1, because it's only the 1 - 3 arguments are readed to executed

## How to run it?
- Install Python in your environment
- Run the code use python and then "simplescript.py" 
- Now, you can run the code
