# Ultra-Simple-Interpreted-Language
## What is this?
Basically, this is a ultra simple interpreted language, like it names, it's so simple. It has a few syntax and very beginner friendly(especially if you're a student), it's written in Python, and with the source code of this, you can also understand the few elements on Python

## Syntax and mechanics
There are only 4 syntax in this very simplified language.
- "out" for print a message, it just like print() in Python but more simple, to use it, first type out, and second click space and then type the text that you want to print
- "in" it's for a user input, it has a very simple mechanics, first type "in" and then space and variables name, after it, now you can enter the value of the variable with in syntax
- variable, so, there's 2 method to declare a variable, the one is with in, and second with declaring variable name, space and then equal sign and after it, click space again and enter a variable value. Variables are mutable and the value can changed it by re-declare it. And variable name can't contain any spaces
- calling a variable, if you want to call the variable, just type the name of variable, and then the value of it will be printed
- "abt" basically, this is just a credit syntax

## How to run it?
- Install Python in your environment
- Run the code use python and then "simplescript.py" 
- Now, you can run the code

## â€¢Next Plan for Future
- Adding math
- Adding a variable type
- Add more utilities syntax
